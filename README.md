# gittuf/github-app

[gittuf](https://github.com/gittuf/gittuf) relies on signed attestations to
represent code review approvals. The gittuf GitHub app is a helpful bridge
between gittuf policies and GitHub's code review workflow for a pull request.

A public good version of this app is hosted for public github.com repositories.
This is hosted via the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) where gittuf is
a sandbox project. See the [getting started guide](docs/getting-started.md).
